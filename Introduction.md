# TUREASY
Tureasy is a general-purpose programming language designed to optimize programs. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and generic programming. 



Tureasy has a smart compiler that helps the user to optimize programs by giving suggestions (tips) during the compilation of the program., using Turzers which use different Ai techniques to provide optimized code.  The suggestions and optimizations are implemented using reflective programming, which is a type of meta-programming. There are private Turzers to secure the content of different organizations. Tags play an important role in the proper implementation of Turzers. Tags also help in identifying bugs during runtime.
