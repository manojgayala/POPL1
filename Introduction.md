# TUREASY
Tureasy is a general-purpose high-level programming language designed to optimize programs. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and generic programming. It is mainly developed as a reflective language to optimize programs. There are libraries additionally which allow the user to use generic programming and concurrent programming whenever necessary.\
The main features of Tureasy are scalability, security, multithreading, easy to learn, produces optimized programs, and is portable. 
Object-oriented programming is also a key feature of Tureasy. The definitions of classes are organized in tureasy for programmer readability. The real-life problems can be coded efficiently in Tureasy based on data abstraction, encapsulation, data hiding and polymorphism. \
The symbols form a key aspect in the Tureasy language syntax.
All the Tureasy programs are written into text files with the extension ". te" for example; hello. te.\


Tureasy has a smart compiler that helps the user to optimize programs by giving suggestions (tips) during the compilation of the program., using Turzers which use different Ai techniques to provide optimized code.  The suggestions and optimizations are implemented using reflective programming, which is a type of meta-programming. There are private Turzers to secure the content of different organizations. Tags play an important role in the proper implementation of Turzers. Tags also help in identifying bugs during runtime.
