~ This is a program to print sum of positive and negative numbers in an array

$main
int x[5] = {23,-4,9,19,-5};                       ~ Declaration of array in Tureasy is similar to that in C. 'int' is a datatype to store integers
int pos_sum = 0, neg_sum=0;                       ~ Declaration and initialization of variables is similar to C

~ The syntax of for-loop is as below (var : [range of the var])
for i : [0,5]
	if x[i] > 0
		pos_sum = pos_sum + x[i]; @       ~ Conditional statements end with a '@'
	else if x[i] < 0
		neg_sum= neg_sum + x[i]; @
/                                                 ~ '/' denotes the end of a loop
