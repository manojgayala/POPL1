# Lessons Learnt
After a lot of research, debates, thought processes, and  hardwork, we have designed a new language close to perfection. During the whole course of our project, we learnt to associate together, share and increase our knowledge to form a strong programming knowledge. We have learned about some foundational concepts of programming languages and analysed their pros and cons. We tried to understand the motivation and need for their language design. We were able to incorporate these values in our design and always questioned the need for every minute component in Tureasy.

### Technical Lessons
* **Convenient Syntax:** ve learned that the syntax must be user friendly as much as possible because ultimately that would increase productivity. The compiler can handle the issues in microseconds so that wouldn't be an issue.
* **Understanding complexity:** We should analyse the design at the early stages for better output. Many ideas which can be theoretically interesting can be difficult in implementations.
* **Design Aspects:** We should cover all the components of programming language for ensuring that wide range of users could use it. Specific purpose designed languages would be successful only if it is the best in that domain.
* **Exposure to various languages:** We have referred to many languages like C, C++, Python, R, Java, etc., to increase our knowledge on programming languages, enhance the design of our language and give the best output to the programmer.
* **Building own concepts:** Creativity has played a major role in developing our language.  We have learnt to build new concepts and tried to apply them for solving real life problems.
* **Adapting features:** We understood the importance of taking inspiration from other languages for better evolution.


### Moral Lessons
* **Teamwork:** We have learned how to get work done by all the team members with each doing some parts but all subordinating personal prominence to the efficiency of the whole.
* **Importance of coordination:** We learned how coordination helps for effective and purposeful outputs. It helped in bringing out the best of individual efforts of all the team members.
* **Knowledge sharing:** We have learned how efficient and fruitful it is to share knowledge through discussions with one another to get the best out of each and every concept handpicked after a lot of thought process.


### Challenges faced
- Miscommunication among team members during the phase of building the language
- Inconsistency within the team on rules/syntax to be followed
- Cross-validation of each otherâ€™s work 
- Bridging the gap between ideas for the language and trying to implement them
