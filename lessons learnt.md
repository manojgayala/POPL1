After a lot of research, debates, thought processes, and  hardwork, we have designed a new language close to perfection. During the whole course of our project,  we have learned to associate together sharing and increasing knowledge to form a strong programming knowledge. We have learned about some foundational concepts of programming languages and have combined the features of various languages to form a stronger set of features, building upon present features to form a better language adding one on one.

**Teamwork:** We have learned how to get work done by all the team members with each doing some parts but all subordinating personal prominence to the efficiency of the whole.
**Importance of coordination:** We learned how coordination helps for effective and purposeful outputs. It helped in bringing out the best of individual efforts of all the team members.
**Knowledge sharing:** We have learned how efficient and fruitful it is to share knowledge through discussions with one another to get the best out of each and every concept handpicked after a lot of thought process.
**Exposure to various languages:** We have referred to many languages like C, C++, Python, R, Java, etc., to increase our knowledge on programming languages, enhance the design of our language and give the best output to the programmer.
**Building own concepts:** Creativity has played a major role in developing our language.  We have learnt to build new concepts and tried to apply them for solving real life problems.
**Adapting features:** We have learned how to combine the best features to provide the pros of all these languages through one language, Tureasy.




### Challenges faced
Miscommunication among team members during the phase of building the language
Inconsistency within the team on rules/syntax to be followed
Cross-validation of each otherâ€™s work 
Bridging the gap between ideas for the language and trying to implement them
